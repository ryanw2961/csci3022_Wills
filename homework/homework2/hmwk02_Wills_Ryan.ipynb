The path E->L has a $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability and from L->H a $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability for a $\\frac{1}{16}$ probability he goes to the hill via library. If he goes the coffe route, he has a $\\frac{1}{4}$ probabilty to go to the coffee shop from engineering center and a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability he goes to the hill from there. This results in a $\\frac{1}{12}$ probability of hill via coffee. Adding all of these together, we get a $\\frac{5}{24}$ probability he ends up at the hill in two moves if leaving from the engineering center. Stella's options are H->G->H, H->L->H, or H->C->H. Leaving from the hill to any of those locations is $\\frac{1}{3}$. If she leaves from the gym or library, she has a $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability of going back to the hill. If she leaves from the coffe shop, she has a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability of going back to the hill. The H->G->H and H->L->H paths have a $\\frac{1}{12}$ probability each and the H->C->H path has a $\\frac{1}{9}$ probabilty. Adding those all together, Stella has a $\\frac{5}{18}$ probability of ending back at the hill after two moves. To get the probability of both Stella and Oscar ending up at the hill after two moves, we just multiply their individual probabilities. $(\\frac{5}{24})(\\frac{5}{18})$ = $\\frac{25}{432}$ or 0.0579 probability or about 6% chance they both end up at the hill after 2 moves."

    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $39$, where squares $0$ and would-be $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 2, 7, 17, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect \\$50, \\$100 or \\$200, or pay the bank \\$50 or \\$100.  There is always an equal probability associated with each of these possible cards.\n",

    "- If a player starts a turn from **Jail** she rolls two dice: \n",

    "    \n",

Note that if a player goes bankrupt during the game you should return their cash as 0 instead of a negative value.  "
