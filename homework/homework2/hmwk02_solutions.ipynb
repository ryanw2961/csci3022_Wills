    "* Six of these 36 outcomes correspond to rolling the same number of both dice (1-1, 2-2, and so on).\n",
    "* Thus, the probability of rolling the same on both dice is $P(\\text{same}) = 6\\cdot 1/36 = 6/36$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time for the slightly tougher part, calculating $P(\\text{differ by one})$\n",
    "* There are five ways for the two dice to come up differing by one: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5 and 5-6\n",
    "* Each of these five ways has two possible \"orientations\": 1-2 and 2-1, for example\n",
    "* This gives 10 distinct outcomes of the total 36, where the dice differ by one\n",

    "You’re on the north shore of a river, and want to cross to the south, via a series of 13 bridges and six islands, which you can see in the diagram below. But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)\n",
