Specifically, he can choose the series to be any odd length, from $N=3, 5, 7 \\dots, 99$ duels long. Assuming that Tony continues to use the service of Darth Ketelsen, and considering the fact that Tony has a better-than-even chance of winning each duel, explain the trade-offs between choosing a short series vs. a long series in terms of Expected Payout.

If Tony chooses a longer series, he has a much higher change of victory, but the Expected Payout is lower due to how many duels he wins. "

In addition to returning the optimal series length, your function should also produce a plot of Expected Payout vs Series Length.
