    "Since we start at 14, there are 0 ways to get from 14 to 14. From nodes 13 down to 11, there is only one edge needed to get to 14. For the remaining nodes, one can find the number of paths needed by adding the number of paths needed by the nodes it is directly pointing to. For example, node 10 takes the sum of paths needed by nodes 11 and 13, so 2 paths.\n",

    "**f**)I implemented the iterative algorithm below and used my four-digit birthday $n=1018$ and the first five digits of $f_n = 40636$. In order to see how long it too my algorithm from (2a), I had to use an online calculator to find $2^{1018}$ which was a massivly large number. I then copied that number and pasted it into an online converter which calculated that it would take my algorithm from (2a) approximately 9 years to find $F_{1018}$. Comparatively, my algorithm from (2d) takes about 1018 nanoseconds or 1.018 microseconds.  \n"
