    "b) **Loop Invariant:** At the start of the iteration with index i of the loop, the variable answer should contain the minimum of the numbers from the subarray A[0:i].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:** At the start of the first loop, we have i=1. Therefore the loop invariant states: \"At the start of the iteration with index i of the loop, the variable answer should contain the minimum of the numbers from the subarray A[0:1], which is A[0].\" This is what answer has been set to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance:** Assume that the loop invariant holds at the start of iteration  i. Then it must be that answer contains the minimum of numbers in subarray  A[0:i] . There are two cases: (1)  A[i]  < answer. From the loop invariant we get that  A[i]  is less than the minimum of the numbers in  A[0:i] . Thus,  A[i]  is the minimum of  A[0:i+1] . In this case, the algorithm sets answer to  A[i] , thus in this case the loop invariant holds again at the beginning of the next loop. (2)  A[i]   $\\geq$  answer. That is, the minimum in  A[0:i]  is at least as small as  A[i] , thus the minimum of  A[0:i+1]  is the same as the minimum of  A[0:i] . The algorithm also doesn't change answer, thus in this case the loop invariant holds again at the beginning of the next loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Termination:** When the for-loop terminates  i=(nâˆ’1)+1=n . Now the loop invariant gives: The variable answer contains the minimum of all numbers in subarray  A[0:n]=A . This is exactly the value that the algorithm should output, and which it then outputs. Therefore the algorithm is correct.  "
