Suppose the drone stops at locations *l*<sub>1</sub>, *l*<sub>2</sub>,..., *l*<sub>n</sub> where *l*<sub>i</sub> is the location of the charging station. If *n* is the first stop made by the algorithm above, then we have shown that there is an optimal solution with the first stop at n. If *l*<sub>1</sub> = n, then *O* is a solution. If *l*<sub>l</sub> != n, then since the algorithm stops at the last possible charging station then *l*<sub>l</sub> must be less than n. Since *O* is optimal and the distance between n and *l*<sub>2</sub> is less than or equal to the distance between *l*<sub>1</sub> and *l*<sub>2</sub>, then there is enough charge to get from n to *l*<sub>2</sub>.
