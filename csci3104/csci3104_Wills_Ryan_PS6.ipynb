    "a) The algorithm splits the balls into pairs so the pairs for the first round of comparisons are:   \n",

    "$B_5$ v $B_6$  \n",
    "$B_7$ v $B_8$  \n",

    "The heaviest balls of each comparison are $B_2, B_4, B_5, B_8$ respectively. The next comparisons are:  \n",

    "$B_5$ v $B_8$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The heaviest ball of that set of comparisons are $B_2$ and $B_8$. The heavier of those balls is $B_2$, making it the heaviest ball.  \n",
    "\n",
    "b) The algorithm takes *n* balls. The first conparison is $\\frac{n}{2}$ comparisons, the second comparison is $\\frac{n}{4}$, the third is $\\frac{n}{8}$, etc, where the *i*th comparison is $\\frac{n}{2^i}$. This equates to $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{2^i}$. Taking out $\\frac{n}{2}$ we end up with $\\frac{n}{2}$ times the geometric series $\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^i}$. That series equates to 2, and $\\frac{n}{2} * 2 = n$.  \n",

    "Starting at the root, you compare the root with the children, and if the root is less than the children, it's the local min. If one of the children is less than the root, than at least one child is less than the root. Choosing the lesser child, we then compare it to its children. If it has none, it is the local min. If it has children and is smaller than them, it's the local min. If a child is smaller, we continue using the same method, until we get to a leaf, which is (log n) nodes down, ensuring that at most it searches (log n) nodes."
