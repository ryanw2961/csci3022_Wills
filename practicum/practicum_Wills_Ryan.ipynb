    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Moodle by **11:55pm on Wednesday December 12**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your final exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on the practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By submitting this assignment, you agree to abide by the rules given above.**\n",

    "- If you have a question for us, post it as a **PRIVATE** message on Piazza.  If we decide that the question is appropriate for the entire class, then we will add it to a Practicum clarifications thread. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",

Different combinations are worth different amounts of points, and the goal of the game is to get as many points as possible.\n",
